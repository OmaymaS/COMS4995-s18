word embeddings are the logical next step in doing text analysis after working
with topic models on Monday.

# Beyond Bags of Words

Limitations of bag of words:
- Semantics of words not captured
- Synonymous words not represented
- Very distributed representation of documents

???

Last time we started talking about limitations of bag of
words, such as semantics of words are not captured
synonymous words are not represented - if I use two
synonymous words, for example film and movie, they are
represented in completely different ways and there is no
connection between them. and we also have a very distributed
representation of documents, which might be hard to
understand or hard to learn from.
---

# Last Time

- Latent Semantic Analysis
- Non-negative Matrix Factorization
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation
- All embed documents into a continuous, corpusspecific
space.
- Today: Embed words in a “general” space.

???

Last time we looked at latent semanic analysis, non-negative
matrix factorization and latent dirichlet allocation. Each
of them embedds the documents into a continuous, corpus
specific space of a dimension of our choosing, using an
unsupervised objective. The first two are matrix
factorization, the third is a probabilistic generative
model.

Today we'll be talking about a more general embedding, which
tries to embedd individual words, not documents. The goal is
to learn an embedding that's generally useful, and not
necessarily tied to a particular corpus.

---
# Idea

- Unsupervised extraction of semantics using large
corpus (wikipedia etc)
- Input: one-hot representation of word (as in BoW).
- Use auxiliary task to learn continuous
representation.

???

We'll talk about several methods, but they'll all use a very
large corpus to create a relatively generic embedding. So we
might use something like wikipedia or google news or a big
corpus of books. It's an unsupervised task, but the way it
is phrased is using an auxiliary supervised task to learn
the embedding. And what I mean by that will be more clear
shortly. The starting principle is a one-hot representation
of each word, as in Bag of words, which basically just
means each word is identified by some index.

---
# Skip-Gram models

- Given a word, predict surrounding word
- Supervised task, each document yields many
examples
- Not interested in performance for this task, just
want to learn representations.

???

A very commonly used auxiliary task is the skip-gram model.
Here the task is, given a word, predict the surrounding
words. This is a supervised task, with each document
providing many examples, basically as many as there are
words in the document. I'm saying this is an auxiliary task,
because we're not really interested in actually solving this
problem of predicting surrounding words, we just want to use
this task to learn useful representations.

# Example
```
[“What is my purpose?”, “You pass the butter.”]
```
.center[
![:scale 50%](images/context_window.png)
]

Using context windows of size 1 (in practice 5 or 10):

???
Here's an example of what this task looks like. Let's say we
have a corpus of two documents, "what is my purpose" and
"you pass the butter". We specify a context window size,
let's say one. Then, for each word that has enough context,
we generate a training example. So for "is", we have a
context of "what" and "my", for "my" we have "is" and
"purpose", and so on. So the input would be "is" and the
goal would be to predict that the word before is "what" and
the word after is "my". that assigns a high probability to
the outputs "what" and "my". In practice larger context
windows are used, often 5-10 words in either direction.
Cearly it's impossible to actually solve this task, because
each word can appear in many different contexts. The goal is
to learn which contexts are likely, and which are not.

---
.center[
![:scale 50%](images/cbow_skipgram_1.png)
]

???
Here’s the architecture that we will be using for this. It's
kind of like neural network only, this is completely linear.
In the left-hand side, we have the input layer with one hot
encoding services in V-dimensional. V represents the size of
vocabulary. And basically, only one of them will be 1 and
the others will be 0.

Then we have a weight matrix connecting it to the
n-dimensional hidden layer. From there, we have multiple
outputs that correspond to the previous word, previous 2
words, and previous 3 words and so on. And then the next
word, next 2 words, next 3 words and so on. 

Each output is, again, one hot encoding, which allows you to
predict each possible version of vocabulary. These layers
here are very large in size.

Behind the hidden layer is basically a logistic regression.
So this is just a linear classifier with a softmax
activation. So each of these Ws will try to predict what the
words are before and after.

Basically, you have one hot encoding, you've multiplied with
the first matrix, and then you multiply it with another
matrix and then you do softmax. The reason why you have
these two matrix multiplication is basically you want to
create a bottleneck so if you had a very wide vector, you
could do one matrix multiplication, basically, you want this
matrix to have a lower rank. So you want to compress a
representation to something small.

Each row of W corresponds to a single word. We train this
whole thing in a supervised fashion to minimize the log
loss. But we’re only interested in is getting weights w.

]
???
The problem is you sum over all the outputs. All the outputs
are all the words in the vocabulary. If you have a million
words in your vocabulary, this is going to be a lot of work.


This is a step that you need to do every time when you want
to optimize it. And so what most of the algorithms do is
they just approximate the sum by sampling some words. So it
just normalizes by some words, but not by all words. 

This is the model that's most commonly used. This is called
skip grams.

# CBOW vs Skip-gram

.center[
![:scale 70%](images/cbow_skipgram.png)

.smallest[
Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf
]
???

This is the skip-gram model, here you can see it on the left
(FIXME?!) So we start with the one-hot-encoding of the word,
and we have a matrix multiplication into a latent space. A
matrix multiplication with a one-hot vector just means that
each row in that embedding matrix represents one word. From
this latent space, we run logistic regression, trying to
predict what the word is for each particular offset, so here
in this picture we're trying to predict the word two to the
left, one to the left, one to the right, and two to the
right. So these are basically four classifiers running on
the same input.

Another approach is shown on the left, the continuous bag of
words model, or CBOW. This is something that seems a bit
more natural to me, where given the context, we are trying
to predict the word in the center. So here we would be given
four context words and try to figure out what's the most
likely word to be in between those.

The skip grams work better. CBOW might capture some things
like synonymous words because I can switch the synonyms word
for another word, and it’ll still make sense in the same
context. So if I say, I watched a movie or I watched the
film, it doesn't really matter. 

---
# Implementations

- Gensim
- Word2vec
- Tensorflow
- Don't train yourself

???
Word2vec uses both the skip grams and continues bag of
words.

You can train this using TensorFlow. If you actually want to
train it yourself, it's probably the best idea because then
you can do it on GPU. These are usually like large matrices,
you have a large corpus which will take forever. With
TensorFlow, you can do it on a GPU and, and it makes things
much more bearable. 

But generally, just don't train it yourself. You can
download several of these word2vec models from Google, for
example.

# Gensim - topic models for humans

- Multiple Latent Dirichlet Allocation implementations
- Wrappers for Mallet and vopal wabbit
- Tools for analyzing topic models
- No supervised learning
- Uses list-of-tuples instead of sparse matrices to
store documents.

???
Gensim is a Python library for text analysis. Gensim is very
easy to use and it has a lot of features. Last time, I
mentioned spacy and NLTK as libraries for NLP, Gensim is the
third one in that list which is very specific to topic
models. And it has multiple implementations of LDA. It has
wrappers for Mallet and vowpal wabbit, which also has very
fast on LDA implementation. It has no supervised learning.
This is all about document retrieval and feature extraction.


The main thing to keep in mind when you work with this and
when you combine this with scikit-learn is that it uses a
list of tuples to store documents instead of sparse
matrices. It's completely equivalent. It's just a different
data structure. But if you want to mix this with
scikit-learn, you need to make sure to convert it.

---
# Introduction to gensim

.smallest[
```python
docs = ["What is my purpose", "You bring butter"]
texts = [[token for token in doc.lower().split()] for doc in docs]
print(texts)
```
```
[['what', 'is', 'my', 'purpose'], ['you', 'bring', 'butter']]
```
```python
from gensim import corpora
dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(texts)
print(dictionary)
```
```
Dictionary(7 unique tokens: ['butter', 'you', 'is', 'purpose', 'my']...)
```
```python
new_doc = "what butter"
dictionary.doc2bow(new_doc.lower().split())
```
```
[(3, 1), (5, 1)]
```
```python
corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(text) for text in texts]
corpus
```
```
[[(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)], [(4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)]]
```
]

???

Use NLTK or spacy or a regexp for tokenization in real
applications. This method here doesn’t even handle
punctuation.
In gensim, a document is represented as list of tuples
(index, frequency), corpus is a list of these.

most transformations is gensim are lazy:
They yield a generator (like Sparse2Corpus) which can
be converted to a list.
Note that the CSC is transposed to what we would expect in sklearn.

You can do a TFIDF model with Gensim.

# Word2Vec in Gensim

```python
from gensim import models
w = models.KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format(
    '../GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin', binary=True)
w['queen'].shape
```
```
(300,)
```
```python
w.vectors.shape
```
```
(3000000, 300)
```
???
There are 2 benefits to using these prebuilt models.
A)  It takes a long time to run to train these 
B) You probably don't have the corpus, you can download
Wikipedia, but I don't think you can actually download the
Google News corpus. 

There are 3,000,000 word vectors in total stored in this
model. So there’s a vocabulary of size 3,000,000. Each of
the words in the vocabulary has a 300-dimensional vector.

I can only apply this to words that are within this
vocabulary. If I have any words that are not in this
vocabulary, then this model is useless.

The first thing that we want to do is to check whether these
representations actually semantic in some way. To do this,
first, we need to define how can we measure similarity in
this space. And the way that similarities usually measured
between words is using the cosine similarity.

---
# Cosine Similarity
.padding-top[

`$$\Large \text{similarity}(v, w)=\cos(\theta) = \frac{v^Tw}{\lVert v\rVert \lVert w \rVert}$$`
]
???
This is quite related to Euclidean distance but basically,
it normalizes the weight, the length of the vector. This is
a set of a distance matrix that’s very commonly used in NLP.
For example, if you want to compare if the two documents are
similar. For documents in the bag of words representation,
this might be quite intuitive, since it just sort of
normalizes the length of document away.

# Inspecting Semantics
```python
w.most_similar(positive=['movie'], topn=5)
```

```
[('film', 0.8676770925521851),
 ('movies', 0.8013108968734741),
 ('films', 0.7363011837005615),
 ('moive', 0.6830361485481262),
 ('Movie', 0.6693680286407471)]
```
???
Now that we know how we can measure similarities in the
space, we can find similar words. And so let's start with
‘movie’ and the top 5 matches for it (ordered from most
similar to least similar top 5)

This computes the cosine similarities between the
300-dimensional vector for movie and all the other
300-dimensional vectors for the 3 million other words and
gives the 5 closest one. In this case, they are ‘film’,
‘movies’, ‘films’, ‘moive’, ‘Movie’. I guess ‘moive’ is a
common misspelling.

---
```python
w.most_similar(positive=['good'], topn=5)
```
???
Trying the same for the word ‘good’ gives ‘great’, ‘bad’,
‘terrific’, ‘decent’ and ‘nice’. ‘bad’ is an antonym not a
synonym for ‘good’, this makes sense since sometimes if we
replace ‘good’ with ‘bad’, it will still make sense.

You can also look at multiple vectors and take the average
and then look what's close to that. I’ve computed for ‘cute’
and ‘dog’.

Maybe it's just because I have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff, but this one got under my skin
(pardon the pun). This piece is brave, not afraid to go over the top and as satisfying as they come in terms
of revenge movies. Not only did I find myself feeling lots of hatred for the screwer and lots of sympathy 
towards the "screwee", I felt myself cringe and feel pangs of disgust at certain junctures which is really a
rare and delightful thing for a somewhat jaded horror viewer like myself. Some parts are very reminiscant of
"Hellraiser", but come off as tribute rather than imitation. It's a heavy handed piece that does not offer 
the viewer much to consider, but I enjoy being assaulted by a film once and awhile. This piece brings it and 
doesn't appologize.
I liked this one a lot. Do NOT watch whilst eating pudding.

This is a silly way to tokenize the input and using only
words that appear in the vocabulary used in the pretrained
model.

Doing the same for movie review. I’m tokenizing this in a
way that only the words that appear in the vocabulary are
actually here because the other words can’t be encoded in
Word2vec. So I get the count vectorizer, I use the
vocabulary in the Word2vec model and then I transform and
inverse transform and I get these results where each of them
has a 300-dimensional vector


So now we have the list of tokens for all the movie reviews.
And the most common way to use this to represent documents
is just using the average. 

---
# Represent doc by average

X_train = np.vstack([np.mean(w[doc], axis=0) for doc in docs])

docs_val = vect_w2v.inverse_transform(vect_w2v.transform(text_val))

lr_w2v = LogisticRegression(C=100).fit(X_train, y_train_sub)

```

```
```python
lr_w2v.score(X_val, y_val)

```
0.857
```

]
???
Right now, each of the tokens is replaced by a
300-dimensional vector. And so I can represent each review
by the mean of all the 300-dimensional vectors of the words.

So previously, I had 18750 lists of 300-dimensional vectors
for the training dataset and now I only have one
300-dimensional vector.

After computing, we can see that we didn't really gain a
lot, but definitely, there's still a lot of information
available to do the sentiment analysis. I think it's better
than using LSA or LDA. 

This still has some downsides of the bag of words in that
you discard to word order.

You can actually also do embedding for bigrams and trigrams.


One of the thing that people found, which was quite
interesting is that you can actually do some sort of
semantic algebra with it.

You can use these vectors to find relationships. So people
found that if they look at the difference between men, and
women, it looks very similar to the difference between uncle
and aunt or king and queen. They also found that, for
example, the difference between King and kings is the same
as between queen and Queens. 

If you want to ask a question, what is to Queen as kings are
to King?

You can take vector representation of Queen and add the
vector representation of kings, and subtract the vector
representation of King. And if you look at the closest point
to that, you'll find it's going to be queens. People did
this with a lot of different sort of semantic pairs.

One thing that's quite interesting is people embedded
countries and their capitals using a 300-dimensional space
and then did the PCA on it. 

This is projecting down to 2-dimensional space, all
different countries and their capitals. 

Even after this projection, they all look pretty peril. And
so basically, the thing that goes from Poland to Warsaw is
basically the same that goes from Japan to Tokyo. You can
use this to discover analogies or relations.

So now we have a space in which vector additions have
semantic meaning. When people found about this, they were

In the first example, I'm computing ‘woman’ + ‘king’ – ‘man’
and the top 3 results are ‘queen’, ‘monarch’ and ‘princess’.
Queen is the highest since ‘man’ is to ‘king’ as ‘women’ is
to ‘queen’.

So relationships that are found here definitely depend a lot
on the corpus that was used.

This relation is actually in there. If you do ‘man is to

They did an analysis of this particular embedding. And
established that we don’t want these gender stereotypes in

Some of them are clearly something that we would not want.
And this is just one particular instance.

As with all machine learning models, this learns all the
biases of the data that you give it, if you give it a lot of
text, then it uses that to learn all the biases of human

# Paragaph Vectors

Alright, so the next thing I want to talk about is a
slightly smarter way to look at embedding documents, which
is paragraph vectors. Instead of just taking averages we're
trying to do a little bit better.

based on cbow, not skip-grams

Add a vector for each paragraph / document, also
randomly initialized.
To infer for new paragraph: keep weights fixed, do
stochastic gradient descent on the representation D,
sampling context examples from this paragraph.

FIXME better explanation.

There is no gradient descent at encoding time for word2vec!


The most common approach here is Doc2vec.

This here on the right-hand side would be the continuous bag
of word model where you get the context, and where you want
to predict the word from the context. What paragraph vector
now does is it adds in another thing, which is a paragraph
specific ID. It’s basically like adding a unique word to a
vocabulary that’s just unique to this paragraph and encodes
its presence in this paragraph. And you do not only learn
the embedding of all the words, but you also learn embedding
for each paragraph. And so basically, this tries to make up
for what the words cannot predict. So you have the standard
CBOW in the middle layer that tries to make a prediction but
then basically trying to correct this prediction by having a
paragraph specific ID. This maybe not sorts of the most
intuitive way. But it actually seemed to work quite well.
This is actually in practice quite a bit trickier than just
looking at the word vectors since how are you going to do
this if you get a new document?

If you get a new document for the word vectors, you just
look for each word, if it's not in the vocabulary you’re
lost out anyway, if it’s in the vocabulary, you can just
take the vector for this word that you have computed
already. 

If you get a new paragraph, how do you get the paragraph
vector?

Since you have a new paragraph that has never seen before,
the paragraph is not in the training set. And so what you do
then you look at the paragraph and you sample training
samples from this paragraph, so your sample context and
words. And you fix all the word vectors because you learned
them on the training sets. You're basically learning this
paragraph ID by doing gradient descent. So you initialize
this paragraph vector randomly and to transform a new
paragraph, you basically learn the paragraph vector for this
paragraph, fixing all the word vectors. 

In this sense, it’s more of trying to correct what the model
could not figure out with the word vectors. So now, you have
a vector that represents everything in the paragraph that
was not already encoded in the context, or it might encode
like in a wider context or something like that. 

And usually, it's just the same dimensionality as the other
vectors. So here, we would get like a 300-dimensional vector
that encodes each paragraph. But to encode a new paragraph
you need to do gradient descent.

fixme example of nearest neighbors to see if this learned
something useful!
Should use the unlabeled reviews!

So here, basically, I started completely fresh from no model
at all. And I learned embedding for all of the words and for
all the paragraphs. So I did a small validation to see if
the word vectors that I learned are meaningful.

I looked at the most similar ones to ‘movie’ and we get
these results.

I like this better than the ones from the pre-built one.
These are pretty good but it's maybe not as surprising as
‘movie’ is sort of the most common word in the whole corpus.

Now I can encode my training corpus.  I get a 50-dimensional
vector for each movie review in the training dataset. If I
want to do classification I can run a logistic regression on
this vector.

So model.infer_vector does the gradient descent to compute
the paragraph vectors for each document. 

In the paper, they used much more data from the same corpus
and they used 400-dimensions and probably they also iterated
longer. In the paper, they didn't train a logistic
regression on this. They trained a neural network on this,
this probably makes a difference

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
lr = LogisticRegression(C=100).fit(X_train, y_train_sub)

```python
lr.score(X_val, y_val)

Not working well here. Either not enough training data,
sgd didn’t converge yet, or too low dimension.
FIXME combine with word vectors?
In the paper: they actually get 0.926%

# GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation


$X_{ij}$ = How often does work j appear in context of word i

`$$ J = \sum\limits_{i,j=1}^{V} f(X_{ij}) (w_i^T \tilde{w_j} + b_i + \tilde{b_j} - \log X_{ij})^2$$`


`$$ 
f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
  (x/x_\text{max})^\alpha & \text{if  } x < x_\text{max}  \\
  1 & \text{otherwise} \\
\end{cases} 
$$`

???

Here X_ij is the coocurrance count matrix, counting
how often word I and j appear in the same context –
say a 5 word window.
We are learning a factorization of log(X_ij) into w_i and
~w_j, where w_i are the word-vectors we want to
extract.
Very infrequent word-pairs are less important to get
right, and are down-weighted using f(X_ij).

alpha is 3/4 empirically. x_max is 100.

# GloVe  Weighting function f

![:scale 90%](images/glove_weighting.png)
???
If you're larger than X max, it's just weighted by 1. If all
words appear at least 100 times then the loss is weighted
fully and if words appear less than 100 times, then you take
x divided by 100 to the power of alpha, and they found alpha
equal to 0.75. So it works better than linear.

So in the beginning, you have to compute this big sparse
matrix once, but then you can do gradient descent just on
this given statistics.
